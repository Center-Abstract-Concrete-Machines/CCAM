cardBlurb: Wood’s practice spans disparate media, shifting from physical to file, performance to film. He produces drawings, text, and moving image that draw from collaged observation and autobiography. Currently he is fascinated by the many phantom plans, and unbuilt proposals that haunt his home town in the north of England, Peterlee.
