    Watershed's mission is to create openings for discussions of the current human predicaments: societal, environmental, economic, and racial. Defining both art and ecology beyond standard expectations, they present programs and exhibits that address our relations with each other and with the natural environment. Through biocultural experiences of place – “watersheds” – they seek emergent ecological knowledge.
