I am an arts and design researcher, theorist, educator, programmer, and performance-installation artist. Currently part-time faculty at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and University of Illinois Chicago, I received PhD in Media Arts and Sciences in December 2022 from the School of Arts, Media, and Engineering at Arizona State University and a certificate in critical theory. I also work as a researcher and consultant on an NEA Lab project with Virginia Tech and Leonardo/ISAST. I am the founding lead of a 501c3 organization called CCAM, the Center for Concrete and Abstract Machines, which supports cultural development at the nexus of art, technology, and contemporary thought located Chicagoâ€™s Pilsen neighborhood.
