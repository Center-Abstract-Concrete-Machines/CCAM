John:
I need to write a 50-100 word bio for myself. My name is John MacCallum and I live in Berlin. I'm a media artist, performer, I did my PhD in Music Composition, but I'm not a traditional composer at the moment, so I don't want to highlight that. I'm also a computer scientist, but I wouldn't phrase it like that. Perhaps "software architect" and/or developer.
