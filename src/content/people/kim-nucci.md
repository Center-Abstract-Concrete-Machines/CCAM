Kim Nucci is an Oakland-based media artist, composer, and technologist. Kim claims to be the Pope of facebook and worships dollar slice pizza as the one true god, while living in the god(pizza)less land of California.

As a musician, they perform on electronics, modular synthesizer, and saxophone. As a visual and sound artist, they create interactive installations using architectural interventions, sculpture, arduino and other microcontrollers, idiosyncratic interactive design, painting and projections. They also VJ, and create generative and audio-reactive video art for live musical performance.
