Muindi Fanuel Muindi is a social practice artist, philosopher, and poet, with Lacustrine Bantu roots in the Rift Forests of Eastern Congo and the Mara Wetlands in Tanzania. 

His philosophical perspective is deeply influenced by Afro-diasporic spiritual and musical traditions, Western deconstruction, and schizoanalysis. His work also draws subtle inspiration from comparative biology and measure theory.

As a social practice artist, Muindi coordinates assemblages of administrative statements, technical implements, built environments, and dramatic elements, which function as laboratories in the Black Arts and Decolonial Sciences. Guided by the motto “more grit, less kit,” Muindi’s practice privileges high latency, low fidelity, seamful designs, and the revival of transformative ecological knowledges (TEK).

Muindi is co-founder of the Fyrthyr Institute for Unsettling Technologies, coordinator of the “Prototyping Social Forms” and “Alter-Eco” research streams at the Synthesis Center, an organizer at the Center for Concrete and Abstract Machines, an associate editor of the journal AI & Society, and co-producer and audio engineer for the Forested Niches podcast. Previously, Muindi was a member of the “After School”, “Technologies of Critical Conscientization”, and “Unwriting Nature” research communities at the Center for Art Design + Social Research.
