name: Ruby Que
cardBlurb: >
    Ruby Que is a queer, itinerant, multidisciplinary artist. In their work they open portals and create hauntings. Many projects grapple with absence: the missing person, the deserted homeland, the obsolete medium, the traumatic memory. They try and often fail to fill, embrace, or expand these gaps with video, sculpture, writing and performance.
