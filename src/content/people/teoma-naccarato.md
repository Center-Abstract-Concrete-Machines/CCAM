name: Teoma Naccarato
cardBlurb: > 
    Teoma Naccarato is a choreographer and media artist based in Berlin. Each hybrid performance-installation she creates is a microcosm: a site to interrogate the ongoing mediation of bodies and identities in techno-cultures. Through the appropriation of surveillance and biomedical technologies, her artistic work engages with the computational and conceptual machinery of representation. Adopting a wide range of formats, including live, livestream, durational, and 1-1 performance, Naccarato’s work has been presented in theaters, galleries, and film festivals internationally. Presently, she is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Centre for Dance Research (C-DaRE) at Coventry University.
