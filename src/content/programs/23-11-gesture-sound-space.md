Multichannel sound workshop run by Oakland/ chicago sound artist, composer, and technologist Kim Nucci.

We will use TriTriangle's unique and portable 16-channel Hypercube stereo system.

From 10 until early afternoon , we will meet at TriTriangle (1550 N Milwaukee). Kim will introduce techniques and approaches for spatialisation of sounds in a Multichannel environment. We will work in maxmsp, as well as port in sound location information to max from p5\*js. Participants will get hands on experience moving sound in space. If you like, bring your own sounds or algorithms.
