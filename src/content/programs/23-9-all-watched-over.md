## overview

Join CCAM and The [Neu Lithium](https://lithium.gallery/) for a screening of Adam Curtis’s ALL WATCHED OVER BY MACHINES OF LOVING GRACE (2011), a gallivanting video essay about love, war, heroism, and computers, and the dream that we could run the world without politics.

Our panel samples the eclecticism of Chicago’s general intellect :

[Seth Brodsky](https://music.uchicago.edu/people/seth-brodsky), musicology and psychoanalysis

[Kristi McGuire](https://falseflags.institute/about/), visual critical studies and its artistic and political outsides

[Doug Rosman](https://dougrosman.com/), critical and speculative computational media art

Followed by [D.A.N. (Drone-Ambient-Noise)](https://droneambientnoise.live/)
