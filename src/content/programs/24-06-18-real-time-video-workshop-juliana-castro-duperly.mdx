## REALTIME VIDEO WORKSHOP

Over two sessions, this workshop is dedicated to developing experimental visual projects, where images are created, manipulated, and mixed in real-time. Participants will engage in the practical mixing and processing of digital video, gaining the technical knowledge to perform a real-time visual performance, with a focus on output techniques in Resolume Arena (video mapping, connectivity with other softwares, and CCTV).

## ARTIST BIO

Juliana Castro Duperly. Video, sound artist, and educator interested in language as a performative act http://castroduperly.com/

Video, sound, and words are plastic media capable of constructing and deconstructing meaning. This duality has forced her to think of her practice as a flexible and fluid place, where language can be perceived as an experience and not as an operational matter. Taking her work to places of vulnerability forces her to have an openness that tends to search for that moment that exists before articulation. She has shown her work in Sónar Bogotá, Mutek.co, Festival Domo Lleno, Visual Art Network of South Africa, Hyde Park Art Center, Elastic Arts, ESS, and Ars Electronica.
