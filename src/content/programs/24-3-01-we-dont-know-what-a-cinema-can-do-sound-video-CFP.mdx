# Overview

Onion City Film Festival and the Center for Concrete and Abstract Machines (CCAM) co-present a live performance program adjacent to the festival exploring “expanded cinema” in an attempt to put cinematic art to the tasks of resistance, rupture, and reconfiguration of mediatic experience. We ask: how can experimental modes of animating sound and moving image reconfigure the possibility of our relating to one another anew?

We invite submissions from a wide range of practitioners and theorists working in "the expanded cinema" broadly conceived through moving image and sound.

All submissions will be consider by the curatorial team. Participation is paid.
