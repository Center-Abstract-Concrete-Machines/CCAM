In collaboration with the Performance Technology Research Group (PTRG) at SAIC, CCAM will sponsor and host entries into Synthux Academy's international synth hackathon. Over four days, teams of 2-3 will work together and with a mentor to develop and document a synth "from scratch" that speaks to this year's theme (TBA). Previous entries span different areas of making and research, including responsive environments, circuit-bending, app development, installation, performance, biomusicology, DJ practices, and more. Check out last year's website for [inspiration](https://www.synthux.academy/events/hackathon-2023).

Participants will have dedicated space in Chicago and provided microcontrollers, tools, and other relevant components. "Prizes" from Arturia are distributed randomly by Synthux to participants who submit a completed project.

Participation is open to all regardless of skill level, although spots are limited.
