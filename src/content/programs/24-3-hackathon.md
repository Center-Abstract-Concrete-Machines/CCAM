    In collaboration with the Performance Technology Research Group (PTRG) at SAIC, CCAM will sponsor and host entries into Synthux Academy's international synth hackathon. Over four days, teams of 2-3 will work together and with a mentor to develop and document a synth "from scratch" that speaks to this year's theme (TBA). Previous entries span different areas of making and research, including responsive environments, circuit-bending, app development, installation, performance, biomusicology, DJ practices, and more (check the website).

    Participants will have dedicated space in Chicago and provided microcontrollers, tools, and other relevant components. "Prizes" from Arturia are distributed randomly by Synthux to participants who submit a completed project.

    Participation is open to all regardless of skill level. DM on instagram or email to get involved.
