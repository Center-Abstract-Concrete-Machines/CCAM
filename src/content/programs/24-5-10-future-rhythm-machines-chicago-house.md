Futurhythm Machines: House (FRM:House) reflects on social forms, expressive technics, and musical experience through Chicago House Music. FRM is a daylong public event (May 2024 at Watershed) featuring a DIY synthesizer workshop, a panel discussion, a diysynth performance + reception.

In the workshop, participants will use inexpensive microcontrollers to create their own modular Chicago house rhythm machines.

Muindi Fanuel Muindi will lead a panel FRM’s themes.

The FRM publication will include a transcription of the panel, DIY synth instructions, and writings on Chicago House Music’s legacy in black music, technology, and sociality by invited authors.

In December we will publish an FRM: Chicago House artist book.
