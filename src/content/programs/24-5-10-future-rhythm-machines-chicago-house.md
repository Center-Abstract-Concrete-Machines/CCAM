In the workshop, participants will use inexpensive microcontrollers to create their own modular Chicago house rhythm machines.

## Panel

Muindi Fanuel Muindi will lead a panel on FRM’s themes including Dr. Thomas Defrantz, professor and practitioner in black social dance and technology, and Duane Powell, music historian, promoter and DJ.

## Publication

This event will seed our first FRM publication, which will include a transcription of the panel, DIY synth instructions, and writings on Chicago House Music’s legacy in black music, technology, and sociality by invited authors.

In December we will publish an FRM: Chicago House artist book.
