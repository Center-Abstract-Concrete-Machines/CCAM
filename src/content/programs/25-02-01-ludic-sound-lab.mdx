# WORKSHOP

The Ludic Sound Lab is a beginner level workshop exploring Unity 2D and FMOD Studio, a third party software that has become an industry standard for sound designers and musicians working in video game development.

Join us for a short talk titled Early Video Game Sound Design and the Politics of Nostalgia (11am-11:45am), followed by a brief introduction to FMOD, a valuable tool for iterative sound design (11:45am - 1:30pm). Participants will receive access to templates for 2D game concepts including a platformer and a top-down roguelike that will enable them to experiment using their own sound libraries. One-on-one project support is available for getting the templates up and working.

# INSTRUCTOR

Patrick Glennon is a musician, educator, and game developer. He regularly composes for dance and performs with the experimental pop trio Big Pal and the electro-acoustic duo Lirra Skirra. He has curated the independent record label Dead Definition since 2016. His studio practice merges electronic instrument design and video game programming through installations that navigate anxiety, labor, and automation. Website: morgue.team
