# WORKSHOP

The Ludic Sound Lab is a beginner level workshop exploring Unity 2D and FMOD Studio, a third party software that has become an industry standard for sound designers and musicians working in video game development.

The workshop will begin with a brief history of sound in early video games and then guide participants through the basics of sound design for 2D games, analyzing and replicating familiar forms including platformers and top-down roguelikes. The workshop will also dive into the potential for creating generative music through 2D game physics.

By the end of the workshop, participants will possess the knowledge and assets necessary for creating a simple 2D game, instrument, or interactive sound art piece. Participants will be introduced to a variety of freeware tools for generating their own unique sound libraries for further experimentation.

This workshop is open to individuals with no experience working in Unity as well as seasoned Unity users who are interested in learning more about FMOD. Some familiarity with coding and C# is helpful but not required. Participants must download Unity, FMOD Studio, and the FMOD Unity Plugin before the workshop. All of these are free and participants will receive detailed instructions for downloading them after registration.
Workshop fee: $45
