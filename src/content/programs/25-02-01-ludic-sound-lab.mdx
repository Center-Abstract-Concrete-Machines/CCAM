# WORKSHOP

The Ludic Sound Lab is a beginner level workshop exploring Unity 2D and FMOD Studio, a third party software that has become an industry standard for sound designers and musicians working in video game development.

The workshop will guide participants through the basics of sound design for 2D games, analyzing and replicating familiar forms including platformers and top-down rougelikes. The workshop will also dive into the potential for creating generative music through game physics. By the end of the workshop, participants will possess the knowledge and digital assets necessary for creating either an application or WebGL port of their own game, instrument, or interactive sound art piece.

This workshop is open to individuals with no experience working in Unity as well as seasoned Unity users who are interested in learning more about FMOD.

Workshop fee: $45
