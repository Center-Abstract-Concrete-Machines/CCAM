# WORKSHOP

CCAM's Estuary Group presents the first peak into the opensource hardware and software ecosystem built around the Eurorack synthesizer format. The Estuary Group is building technology, curriculum, and artistic opportunities to make musical/sonic synthesis by analog/digital means more accessible in the Chicago community and beyond.

This workshop will allow folks to see what we've been working on, to experiment with the hardware and try out some of the software we've been cooking, and to find ways to get involved if you are interested!
