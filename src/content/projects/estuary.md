Growing out the Gen~ Working Group from Summer and Fall 2023 as well as the initial FUTURE-RHYTHM-MACHINES event, ESTUARY is a group of musicians, technologists, researchers, and designers who work together to develop, teach, and experiment with sonic technics. ESTUARY is particularly interested in workflow interface between the digital and analog, the abstract and concrete.

We are currently working to develop performance applications and documentation for CCAM Earth, a standalone, low-cost synthesizer which is interoperable with other units via control voltage. We are also working on a low-cost Eurorack ecosystem based around the Electrosmith Daisy and Arduino Nano microcontroller systems.
