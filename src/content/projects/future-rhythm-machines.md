Contemporary discourse around historical electronic music forms such as Chicago house or Detroit techno correctly flag the whitewashing of these musical forms’ black and queer genealogies. By misattributing the origins of house music to white Europeans like David Guetta, we indeed cheat musicians’ like Derrick Carter, Frankie Knuckles, and Ron Hardy of their due credit while flattening the historical, material, social, and racial contexts. The repercussions of this anti-black and anti-queer erasure not only acts upon our historical recounting of the past, but our ability to conceive of musical gatherings’ future potential for radical rupture. In the era of the billion-dollar-a-year EDM festival industry, Chicago House cannot be re-imagined as a “humble beginning” but rather a model for contemporary collectivities to come.

To this end, our event asks: What can the history of Chicago House teach us about Future Rhythm Machines? In both workshop and panel we focus on the material, social, and technical particularities of Chicago house (the synthesizers and drum machines of the time and place, the spaces that hosted the parties and transportation modes, the music industry in that historical moment) to draw together a musical map for the future.
