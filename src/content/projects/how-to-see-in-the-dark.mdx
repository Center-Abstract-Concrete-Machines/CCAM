# How to See in the Dark

To see these days as dark[^1] is nothing new: welcome to the party. And we don't speak in absolutes, but in propositions (what if?), speculations (we don’t know yet): that the most optimistic take possible is that we are in 1000 years of darkness.

We are 532 years into a long darkness. Deep time, geological time. Of course, we are good empiricists who figure the sun will come out tomorrow[^2]. But these winter winds burn our ears: it's going to get worse before it gets worse. Stay with the worse.

We will not settle for anything less than this understanding of our situation; anything less suggests that this thing will "work itself out". We know better, that no one is coming to save us[^3].

There is no going back, but there are eternal recurrences on human, geological, and cosmic scales: witch hunts, genocides, 1970s ecospirituality, tectonic collisions, toxic wildfire ash blotting out Hollywood’s golden light, the formation of black holes and the birth of stars. It's going to get weirder before it gets weirder. Stay with the weirder.

It is is a time of paradox[^4], where we must begin to give up old convictions, to divorce from what "everybody knows". Crack open your enclosures, your closed systems of being, thinking, seeing, and acting. In search of the opposite of suicide. Know-how, but also know-when: just because you've opened a portal doesn't mean you need to step through it.[^5]

Fear is the mind killer, but irony will poison a generational ecology of mind[^6], and what is at stake is nothing less than an intergenerational project. The Law of Great Peace by the People of Longhouse. The Haudensee's Seven Generation Principle[^7]. Chicago South Branch River Autonomous Zone. Communists, like us [^8].

We are not asking anyone to believe. Belief is killer of becoming [^9]. God is a dark precursor[^10] to act without waiting to be told. Magic[^11]. Reclaim animism[^12]. Reverse Catholicism, make a pantheon.

The smoke of burned witches[^13][^14] hangs in our nostrils. If we do not dream, we surrender to the dreams of others, and the dream of the other will fuck us and fuck us up. Dream, baby, dream[^17].

This year is no darker than last, but things are speeding up: acceleration is a spell. Softbank's fifty billion dollars to OpenAI and state-subsidized 1000x production of liquid natural gas to power data farms. It is not a simple matter of decelerating the flows. It is about understanding our capacity to redirect them, not just today or in four years, but four hundred. Plans within plans. Count to three: third-order cybernetics. Heal the bifurcation of nature[^18]: re-enchant the world[^19].

Heinz von Foerster: "If you want to see, learn how to act.[^20]"[^21]

-   Garrett Laroy Johnson, in conversation with Dakota Gearhart, Brian Holmes, Anna Johnson, Muindi Fanuel Muindi, Mira Petrillo, and Nick Wylie.

[^1]: "When the night itself is there, there is no longer anything to see [...] Though there is no longer anything to see, we see and do not see nothingness. We see the darkness. [...] When we close our doors to forces that may prey on us under the cover of darkness, we redouble the visible night with an auditory night, an olfactory night, a tactile night." - Alfonso Lingis, "Nightwatch".

[^2]: "It's nice to talk like everybody else, to say the sun rises, when everybody knows it's only a manner of speaking." - Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus.

[^3]: “For Brin the true lesson of 9/11 was given by the passengers of flight 93, ordinary people who were able to act and make a difference without waiting for an authority to tell them. They were able to do so because they had the means to know, understand and think the situation they were in. This is what Brin casts his lot with. Messy, chaotic, undependable as people may be, he will resist any nostalgia or wish for a wise authority which would lead them back to a trusting, obedient position. Only they can make the difference we need.” - Isabelle Stengers, “Gaia, The Urgency to Think and Feel”.

[^4]: “When I say "Alice becomes larger," I mean that she becomes larger than she was. By the same token, however, she becomes smaller than she is now. Certainly, she is not bigger and smaller at the same time. She is larger now; she was smaller before. But it is at the same moment that one becomes larger than one was and smaller than one becomes." - Gilles Deleuze. “First Series of Paradoxes of Pure Becoming”. Logic of Sense.

[^5]: See the Winkie’s Diner scene from David Lynch’s Mulholland Drive.

[^6]: “Above all it is the quality of the laughter that interests me. I do not want a mocking laughter, or a laughter of derision, an irony that always and without risk recognizes the same thing beyond the differences. I would like to make possible the laughter of humor, which comprehends and appreciates without waiting for salvation, and can refuse without letting itself terrorize. I would like to make possible a laughter that does not exist at the expense of scientists, but one that could, ideally, be shared with them.” + “Irony opposes power to power.” + “Humor, by contrast, is an art of immanence.” - Isabelle Stengers. The Invention of Modern Science.

[^7]: “24. The Lords of the Confederacy of the Five Nations shall be mentors of the people for all time. The thickness of their skin shall be seven spans—which is to say that they shall be proof against anger, offensive actions and criticism. Their hearts shall be full of peace and good will and their minds filled with a yearning for the welfare of the people of the Confederacy. With endless patience they shall carry out their duty and their firmness shall be tempered with a tenderness for their people. Neither anger nor fury shall find lodgment in their minds and all their words and actions shall be marked by calm deliberation.” - The Constitution of the Iroquois Nations: The Great Binding Law, Gayanashagowa.

[^8]: “Real communism consists in creating the conditions for human renewal: activities in which people can develop themselves as they produce, organizations in which the individual is valuable rather than functional. Accomplishing this requires a movement - to change the character of work itself. And redefining work as creative activity can only happen as individuals emerge from stifled, emotionally blocked rhythms of constraint. It will take more than the will to change, in the current situation; to resist neutralization itself demands desire.” - Felix Guattari and Tony Negri. Communists Like Us.

[^9]: "God is only a spell cast upon existence. He comes along like hail, sometimes dew or a storm." - Felix Guattari. “I am God, Most of the Time.” Chaosophy.

[^10]: “Thunderbolts explode between different intensities, but they are preceded by an invisible, imperceptible dark precursor, which determines their path in advance but in reverse, as though intagliated.” - Gilles Deleuze. Difference and Repetition.

[^11]: "The magical universe is made of a network of access points to each domain of reality: thresholds, summits, limits, and crossing points, attached to one another through their singularity and their exceptional character." + “We suppose that technicity results from a phase shift of a unique, central, and original mode of being in the world: the magical mode; the phase that balances out technicity is the religious mode of being. Aesthetic thought appears at the neutral point, between technics and religion, at the moment of the splitting of the primitive magical unity: it is not a phase, but rather a permanent reminder of the rupture of unity of the magical mode of being, as well as a reminder of the search for its future unity.” - Gilbert Simondon. “The Genesis of Technicity.”

[^12]: “[...] connections may also be needed to heal and to learn. Where the dangerous art of animating in order to be animated is concerned, what connects may be practical learning about the needed immanent (critical) attention. Not about what is good or bad in itself, but about what Whitehead called realization. Again, no mode of realization may be taken as a model, only as calling for pragmatic reinvention. In order to honor the making of connections, to protect it against models and norms, a name may be required. Animism could be the name for this rhizomatic art [...] Reclaiming animism does not mean, then, that we have ever been animist. Nobody has ever been animist because one is never animist “in general,” only in terms of assemblages that generate metamorphic transformation in our capacity to affect and be affected—and also to feel, think, and imagine. Animism may, however, be a name for reclaiming these assemblages, since it lures us into feeling that their efficacy is not ours to claim. Against the insistent poisoned passion of dismembering and demystifying, it affirms that which they all require in order not to enslave us: that we are not alone in the world.” - Isabelle Stengers. “Reclaiming Animism”.

[^13]: “The reclaiming movement of the neo-pagan witches, which survived the attack together with other activists, has learned a lot since, but it was certainly not helped by frowning and pouting academics. The witch Starhawk had some reason to write that “The smoke of the burned witches still hangs in our nostrils”. In our academic nostrils it hangs with the obsessive fear to be accused of being dupe, of having forgotten that the academic first duty is to debunk belief, that is, to honour a truth the first attribute of which is to hurt.” - Isabelle Stengers. “Gaia, on the Urgency to Think and Feel”.

[^14]: "And lynched negros hangs in our nostrils. , betraying the sacrifices haunting the tabula rasas upon which Freud and Stanley rationalized their maps and legends of dark continents[^15]—their patriarchal fantasies of feminine sexuality, their supremacist fantasies of the bestiality of Blackest Africa. And the horror, the horror urges us to think and feel[^16]. What is being reminded is the imperative to dream—not to study The Interpretation of Dreams, but simply to have them, because to dream is itself an act of interpreting reality." - Muindi Fanuel Muindi “It takes little imagination to understand, now, how the powerful—and for the children who were forced to watch, no doubt traumatic—experience of watching the torture, mutilation, and burning alive of the Afro-American victim would have become encoded forever, through the overwhelming odor of his roasting body, on the memories of all who participated [in the lynching].”- Orlando Patterson, Rituals Of Blood: The Consequences Of Slavery In Two American Centuries.

[^15]: “[T]he id is sutured to the Black woman as both “subjected to repression” in constructions of modern notions of gender and femininity, and the “dark continent” of Freud’s female sexuality." - Selamawit D. Terrefe, Dissociative States: The Metaphysics of Blackness and the Psychic Afterlife of Slavery.

[^16]: "The left needs, in a vital manner, people to think, that is to say also to imagine, to feel, to formulate their own questions and their own demands, to determine the unknowns of their own situation." - Isabelle Stengers. In Catastrophic Times: Resisting the Coming Barbarism.

[^17]: “Come open up your heart / Come on and open up your heart / Come on and open up your heart / Come on dream on, dream baby dream” - Suicide. “Dream Baby Dream”.

[^18]: What I am essentially protesting against is the bifurcation of nature into two systems of reality, which, in so far as they are real, are real in different senses. One reality would be the entities such as electrons which are the study of speculative physics. This would be the reality which is there for knowledge ; although on this theory it is never known. For what is known is the other sort of reality, which is the byplay of the mind. Thus there would be two natures, one is the conjecture and the other is the dream.” + “For natural philosophy everything perceived is in nature. We may not pick and choose. For us the red glow of the sunset should be as much part of nature as are the molecules and electric waves by which men of science would explain the phenomenon. It is for natural philosophy to analyse how these various elements of nature are connected.”- Alfred North Whitehead. Theories of the Bifurcation of Nature. The Concept of Nature.

[^19]: “Is the mechanization and even robotization of our daily life the best that thousands of years of human labor can produce? Can we imagine reconstructing our lives around a commoning of our relations with others, including animals, waters, plants, and mountains—which the large-scale construction of robots will certainly destroy? This is the horizon that the discourse and the politics of the commons opens for us today, not the promise of an impossible return to the past but the possibility of recovering the power of collectively deciding our fate on this earth. This is what I call re-enchanting the world.” - Sylvia Federici. Re-enchanting the World: Reclaiming the Commons.

[^20]: “To this day, it does not appear possible for the two reticulations, that of technics within the geographical world and that of religions in the human world, to analogically encounter each other in a real, symbolic relation. And yet only in this way could the aesthetic impression state the rediscovery of the magical totality, by indicating that the forces of thought have once again found one another. Aesthetic feeling, common to both religious thought and technical thought, is the only bridge that could allow for the linking of these two halves of thought that result from the abandonment of magical thought.” + Gilbert Simondon. The Genesis of Technics.

[^21]: “If you act on expressive material, then you will see the possibility of a new, trans-subjective form of human being. You will no longer see a controlled individual. You will see a complex and resistant multiplicity.” - Brian Holmes. "Count to Three".
