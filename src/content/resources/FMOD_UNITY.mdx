## Ludic Sound Lab Download Instructions for Unity and FMOD

Versions:
Unity: _2022.3.56f1 LTS_
FMOD Studio: #2.02.25 (Unity Verified)\*

### Getting Unity and FMOD set up on your machine requires four main steps:

1. Downloading Unity Hub and creating a Unity account
2. Downloading the Unity Editor through the Unity Hub (version: 2022.3.56f1 LTS)
3. Creating a free FMOD account and downloading FMOD Studio (version: 2.02.25)
4. Adding FMOD Unity Plugin to “My Assets” in the Unity Asset Store and
   downloading it in Unity’s Package Manager

## Unity Hub - this application allows us to install different versions of Unity on our machine

and to manage our Unity Projects

1. [Unity Hub Download](https://unity.com/download) (600~mb)
   a. Download UnityHubSetup.dmg
   b. Agree to unity terms of service to Install
   c. Once you open it you will be prompted to register a free account.

Unity Editor - this is the actual program Unity which can be downloaded once you have
downloaded Unity Hub and registered an account

1. Skip the recommended install
2. Go to “Install Editor” in the top right corner
3. Look under “other versions” and Install 2022.3.56f1 LTS
4. In the Modules window: download the following
   a. Visual Studio
   b. Platforms you would like to make games for (for example select Mac and
   Windows if you would like to make desktop applications, select WebGL to enable
   exporting games for browser projects)

## FMOD Studio Installation - This is the 3d party “middleware” we will use to manage and

trigger sounds in our games.

1. Visit [FMOD.com](http://fmod.com) and register a free account
2. Navigate to downloads then select: 2.02.25 (Unity Verified)

## FMOD Unity Plugin Download - We need to add FMOD Unity Plugin to “our assets” in the

Unity Asset store. This is free and accomplished easily:

1. Navigate to Unity Asset Store and click “Add to My Assets” for the FMOD Unity Plugin
   https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/audio/fmod-for-unity-161631 (This will
   require being logged into your account on Unity)
2. After you have added FMOD for Unity to your assets, open a new project in Unity,
   navigate to the package manager, then to My Assets to find FMOD for Unity. Click
   download. Once the package is downloaded, click Import.
