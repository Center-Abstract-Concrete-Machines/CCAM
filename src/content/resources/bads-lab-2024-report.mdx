# BADS_Lab 2024 Report

## BLACK ARTS & DECOLONIAL SCIENCES (BADS_Lab)

### May 10–19, 2024 | Watershed Art & Ecology, Chicago, IL

## Overview

BADS_Lab 2024 brought together a diverse cohort of artists, researchers, and thinkers committed to exploring decolonial approaches to art and science. Rooted in a kinmaking ethos, world-building practices, and a wayfinding aesthetic, BADS_Lab operated as an experimental space for creative inquiry. The lab interrogated colonial practices of brutalization and specialization while fostering a collective reimagining of how beings and systems might be approached with care and plurality.

Key themes included _coloniality and decoloniality_, _brutality and fugitivity_, and _futurity and ancestrality_, examined through collaborative experiments, public discussions, and immersive art research.

## Key Practices and Contributions

### Ladipo Famodu: Wire Characters and the Liberation of Play

Ladipo’s work centered on malleable “wire characters,” dynamic sculptures that resist rigid representation. His practice critiqued the power of systems—scientific, linguistic, or societal—to reduce life’s complexity into controllable models. By inviting participants into playful, improvisational engagements, Ladipo created a space for collective rethinking of constraints, highlighting the transformative potential of collaborative storytelling and physical interaction.

### Nimrod Astarhan: Speculative Computation and Cultural Fragility

Nimrod reimagined computation as grounded in ecological and cultural rhythms, challenging the abstraction of modern techno-science. Drawing from the speculative lineage of the Khazar kingdom, they designed a fragile computational prototype that responded to energy limitations with deep yet playful cultural symbolism, such as an evil eye emoji. This work critiqued extractive systems and proposed a slow, intentional engagement with technology.

### Jared Brown: Rhythms of Resistance and Sonic Sanctuary

Through sound and rhythm, Jared explored the interplay of resistance and healing within Black American subcultures. Their work emphasized the transformative power of collective rhythm, creating sonic spaces that oscillate between calm and chaos. As their DJ persona, girly\*\*\*, Jared’s performance during the Futurhythmachines event invoked the liberatory ethos of Chicago House Music, fostering connection and collective care.

### Letaru Dralega: Scarred Histories and Metaphysical Belonging

Letaru’s practice used collage, sound, and texture to explore memory, postcolonial wounds, and speculative belonging. Inspired by African and Afrodiasporic ontologies, her gold-leafed, scar-like patterns transformed historical ruptures into sites of beauty and reflection. Letaru’s work proposed that belonging emerges not by erasing fractures but by navigating their complexities with openness and creativity.

## Key Events

### Public Showcase & Closing Reception

On May 18, fellow residents reflected on their work with the public, presenting their sketches and experiments. This closing event highlighted the provisional, process-oriented nature of BADS_Lab, emphasizing inquiry over resolution.

## Impact and Insights

BADS_Lab 2024 emerged as a powerful platform for experimental, interdisciplinary engagement with decoloniality. Through playful improvisation, speculative computation, rhythmic resistance, and embodied archives, participants crafted new ways of knowing, being, and creating together. The lab challenged colonial paradigms, offering glimpses of alternative futures rooted in care, multiplicity, and transformation.

### Key Takeaways:

-   _Decolonial Art Research_: BADS_Lab demonstrated that art research need not strive for resolution but can thrive in the provisional and processual.
-   _Play and Improvisation_: Ladipo and Jared emphasized the liberatory potential of open-ended engagement, where constraints become opportunities for collective creativity.
-   _Fragility as Resistance_: Nimrod and Letaru revealed the power of fragility—whether of computation or scarred materials—as a counterpoint to colonial narratives of permanence and domination.

-   _Sound and Rhythm_: Jared’s work reaffirmed the ephemeral and relational as potent tools for resistance and care, challenging the dominance of materiality in contemporary practices.

BADS_Lab 2024 leaves behind a legacy of speculative inquiry and collaborative experimentation, reminding us that even within the fractures of history, spaces for connection, imagination, and transformation persist.
