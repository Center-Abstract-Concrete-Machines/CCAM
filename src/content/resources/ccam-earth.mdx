CCAM EARTH is built around a microcontroller called Daisy Seed. This means it's reprogrammable and in the future you can upload code written in a number of different languages, including Max/MSP Gen~, Arduino and more. We hope to build community around the sharing of software for this platform.

For the Future Rhythm Machines: Chicago House workshop in May 2024, we created a zine documenting the hardware and software. Click below to [download](/assets/pdf/2024-05-10-CCAM-EARTH-ZINE.pdf).
