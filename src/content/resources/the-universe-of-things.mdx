Steven Shaviro explores the common insistence of speculative realism on a noncorrelationist thought: that things or objects exist apart from how our own human minds relate to and comprehend them. Bringing together a wide array of contemporary thought, The Universe of Things is an invaluable guide to the evolution of speculative realism and the provocation of Alfred North Whiteheadâ€™s pathbreaking work.
