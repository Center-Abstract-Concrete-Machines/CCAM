            CCAM is an artist-run platform at the nexus of art, technology, and
            contemporary thought.

                CCAM’s primary goal is building an accessible community for the
                development and sharing of abstract ideas and forms of technical
                know-how, know-when, and know-why historically siloed in
                academia. Reciprocally, CCAM aims to hybridize the art,
                technology, and research cultures it borrows from the academy by
                drawing on and inviting in queer, anti-racist, and decolonial
                perspectives. By intentionally developing this community outside
                of the academy, CCAM seeks to break down barriers to access for
                engaging in research in art, technology, and surrounding
                criticism and theory. CCAMstrives to center queer, anti-racist,
                and decolonial perspectives in art and art technology.

                CCAM serves artists in our community by offering donation-based
                seminars, talks, and working groups investigating the liberatory
                potentials of different theories of art, science, and
                technology. In its workshop programming and future residency
                offerings, CCAM takes a para-academic approach that prioritizes
                transdisciplinary exchange between residents, mentors, and
                guests. CCAM’s focus on technology aims to provide artists with
                diverse and experimental approaches to expressive interactive
                media art creation. We build community through collaborative
                learning workshops and working groups focused on both
                bleeding-edge toolkits as well as DIY and open-source platforms
                for sound and video instrument composition.
